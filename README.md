## Context

So far the only way you have checked your firmware is by flashing it and watching
the LED. That is slow, manual, and tells you *something* is wrong but never
*where*. Professional embedded teams catch most logic bugs long before the board
is involved, using **unit tests**: small programs that run a single function on
the PC and assert it behaves correctly — in milliseconds, automatically, on every
push.

In this lab you test the GPIO driver you wrote in Labs 1–2 using **Ceedling**,
the standard C unit-test environment, which bundles **Unity** (assertions),
**CMock** (automatic mocks) and **CException** (exceptions). You will test the
driver two ways: directly, against simulated registers; and through a small
application module, by mocking the driver away entirely.

> **Nothing runs on the board in this lab.** Every test compiles and runs on your
> host PC. That is the point — fast, hardware-free feedback on your logic.

---

## Objectives

- Explain what a unit test is and why it matters for embedded development.
- Write tests with Unity: the `test_*`/`setUp` structure, Arrange-Act-Assert,
  and the `TEST_ASSERT_*` macros.
- Use the TDD cycle (RED → GREEN) to drive a small implementation.
- Replace a dependency with a **CMock** mock and verify how it was called.
- Handle and test errors with **CException** (`Try`/`Catch`/`Throw`).
- Test register-level driver code on the host using a fake register block.
- Measure line coverage with **gcov**.

---

## Getting Started

This lab needs **two tools** on your Windows PATH:

1. **Ruby + Ceedling** — the test framework already installed.
2. **MinGW-w64 (gcc + gcov)** — the native host compiler that Ceedling uses to
   build and run tests on your PC.

### Installing MinGW-w64 (gcc / gcov)

The zip for **Windows x86-64** is available in the **aula virtual**, in the
Lab 4 section. It is the _winlibs_ distribution of MinGW-w64 with GCC 16.1.

1. Download the zip from the aula virtual (Lab 4 section).
2. Extract its contents to `C:\mingw64` — after extraction the compiler should
   be at `C:\mingw64\bin\gcc.exe`.
3. Add to PATH **without administrator privileges** — **OPEN POWERSHELL** and run:

   ```powershell
   [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", "C:\mingw64\bin;" + [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", "User"), "User")
   ```

4. **Close** the PowerShell window and open a **new** terminal (Git Bash or
   PowerShell). Verify:

   ```bash
   gcc --version
   gcov --version
   ```

   Both should respond with version information (GCC 16.1.0 or similar).

### Verify all prerequisites

```bash
# 1 — clone your repository and enter it
git clone https://github.com/<org>/<assigned-repo>.git
cd <assigned-repo>

# 2 — verify the tools answer (Git Bash)
gcc --version
gcov --version
ruby --version
ceedling version

# 3 — run the warm-up exercises immediately (they need no firmware)
make exercises

# 4 — later (Phase 2) carry your completed Lab 2 driver into this workspace
bash scripts/copy_lab2.sh <path-to-your-lab2-repo>
```

Read [`docs/ceedling_guide.md`](docs/ceedling_guide.md) whenever you need a
concept refresher.

Total: ~2 h 20 m plus reading. Work the phases in order.

## Phase 0 — Why unit testing

**Read [`docs/ceedling_guide.md` §1–§3](docs/ceedling_guide.md#1-why-unit-testing).**
Before writing any test, make sure you can answer:

- What does a unit test check, and how is that different from flashing the board?
- What is the **Arrange-Act-Assert** shape of a test?
- What do `setUp` and `tearDown` do, and why does each test get a clean slate?

This phase is reading only — it gives the vocabulary the rest of the lab uses.

---

## Phase 1 — Warm-up: Ceedling, Unity, CMock, CException

**Before touching your driver**, complete the four exercises in
[`docs/exercises/`](docs/exercises/README.md). They are self-contained (no
firmware needed) and cover every tool this lab uses.

```bash
make exercises          # runs all four; or cd docs/exercises && ceedling test:all
```

| Exercise | You learn                                          | File                                   |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Ex 1     | Unity assertions, test anatomy, AAA                | `docs/exercises/test/test_calculator.c`|
| Ex 2     | Test-Driven Development (RED → GREEN)              | `docs/exercises/test/test_clamp.c`     |
| Ex 3     | Mocking a dependency with CMock                    | `docs/exercises/test/test_temperature.c`|
| Ex 4     | Exceptions with CException (`Try`/`Catch`/`Throw`) | `docs/exercises/test/test_safe_divide.c`|

**Check (M1):** every exercise suite passes with no `IGNORED` tests. ✓

---

## Phase 2 — Test your GPIO driver

Now bring in the driver you wrote and test it for real. Lab 4 ships the tests but
not the driver — you test *your* code.

```bash
bash scripts/copy_lab2.sh <path-to-your-lab2-repo>   # copies src/ and inc/ in
make test                                            # builds + runs all tests
```

Open [`test/test_gpio.c`](test/test_gpio.c). It tests `gpio.c` directly: instead
of a real peripheral address, the driver is handed `fake_gpio_port()` — a block
of ordinary memory provided by
[`test/support/fake_registers.h`](test/support/fake_registers.h) — and you check
what the driver wrote with the `FAKE_MODER`/`FAKE_IDR`/`FAKE_BSRR` accessors.

Study the worked example, then complete the TODOs:

| TODO   | Test                                                                |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P2.1   | `gpio_config_input` sets the pin's MODER field to `00`              |
| P2.2   | configuring one pin does not corrupt a neighbour's bits             |
| P2.3   | `gpio_read` returns the pin level from IDR                          |
| P2.4a  | `gpio_write` with value ≠ 0 writes `(1 << pin)` to BSRR            |
| P2.4b  | `gpio_write` with value = 0 writes `(1 << (pin + 16))` to BSRR     |

> **Why fake registers?** Your driver writes to addresses like `base + 0x14`. On
> the chip those are registers; on a PC they are nothing. Pointing the driver at
> real memory lets the exact same driver code run on the host. See
> [`docs/ceedling_guide.md` §7](docs/ceedling_guide.md#7-testing-register-level-driver-code).

**Check (M2):** `make test` shows `test_gpio` passing, all four TODOs done. ✓

---

## Phase 3 — Mock the driver and measure coverage

Code that *uses* the driver should not re-test the driver — it should assume the
driver works and check its own logic. That is what mocking is for.

[`src/app.c`](src/app.c) (provided) holds the button→LED logic, extracted from
`main()` so it can be tested. Open [`test/test_app.c`](test/test_app.c): it
includes `mock_gpio.h`, so every `gpio_*` call is a mock you control and verify.

| TODO              | Test                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P3.1              | `app_step` drives LD2 low when B1 reads low                         |
| P3.2              | `app_init` configures the clocks and pins in the correct order      |
| P3.3 *(optional)* | `app_step` forwards the raw read value without filtering            |

Then measure how much of your driver the tests exercise:

```bash
make coverage          # runs tests with gcov and prints a coverage summary
```

Aim to cover the pin-level functions of `gpio.c` — `config_input`,
`config_output`, `read`, `write`, including both sides of each `if`.
`gpio_enable_clock` stays uncovered on purpose: it targets the real RCC register
and cannot run against a fake port (see
[Phase 2](#phase-2--test-your-gpio-driver)), so do not chase 100% — covering the
four pin functions is the goal. See
[`docs/ceedling_guide.md` §8](docs/ceedling_guide.md#8-coverage-with-gcov).

**Check (M3, M4):** `test_app` passes; `make coverage` prints a per-file summary
showing every pin-level path in `gpio.c` exercised. ✓

## Milestones

| Milestone                          | How to verify                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| M1 — Warm-ups pass                 | `make exercises` → all four suites `OK`, no `IGNORED`               |
| M2 — Driver tested                 | `make test` → `test_gpio` passes; TODOs P2.1–P2.4b implemented       |
| M3 — App logic tested with mocks   | `make test` → `test_app` passes; TODOs P3.1–P3.2 implemented         |
| M4 — Coverage measured             | `make coverage` runs and reports line coverage for `gpio.c`/`app.c`  |
| M5 — All green in CI               | The **Lab 4 — Unit Tests** workflow passes on your last push         |

---

## CI and submission

Every `push` triggers the **Lab 4 — Unit Tests** workflow, which:

```text
gem install ceedling                       →  installs the test environment
ceedling test:all   (in docs/exercises/)   →  runs the warm-up suites (always)
ceedling test:all                          →  runs test_gpio + test_app, once your
                                              Lab 2 driver has been carried in
ceedling gcov:all                          →  prints the coverage summary
```

The warm-up step goes green once Phase 1 is done. The driver/app step goes green
once you have carried your Lab 2 sources in with `copy_lab2.sh` **and committed
them**, and your TODOs pass. Results appear in the **Actions** tab. Submission is
the last commit pushed before the deadline.

### Commit conventions

```text
test(lab4): complete Unity assertions in warm-up exercise 1
test(lab4): add fake-register tests for gpio_read and gpio_write
test(lab4): mock gpio.h to verify app_step and app_init
docs(lab4): carry Lab 2 driver into the workspace
```
